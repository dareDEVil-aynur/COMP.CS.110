/* Class: University
 * -----------------
 * COMP.CS.110 Ohjelmointi 2: Rakenteet / Programming 2: Structures
 * -----------------
 * Class representing a simple university with students, staff and courses.
 *
 * Note: Students shouldn't need to make changes to the existing functions
 * or their implementations.
 *
 * Overview:
 *   The code embodies a University class which governs the courses and
 * student accounts within the system. It includes methods to construct
 * both courses and student accounts, integrate students and staff into
 * courses, enroll and complete courses, along with delivering details about
 * courses and accounts.
 *   During each interactive cycle, the software solicits user engagement
 * via commands, which can be displayed by typing "help" or "h". This
 * University class leverages both the Account and Course classes to manage
 * student data and respond appropriately to user commands.
 * The application concludes once the user initiates a quit command ('q' or 'Q').
